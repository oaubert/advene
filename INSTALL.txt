How to install the Advene prototype

* Requirements:

** Video player

The video player is implemented on all platforms with the gstreamer
framework, through the python-gstreamer module (>= 1.0).

** Linux version

You will need the following python packages (the package names are from
Debian, they may slightly vary on other distributions) :

python >= 3.5
python3-gi
python3-gst
gir1.2-gstreamer-1.0
python3-gi-cairo
gir1.2-gtk-3.0 (>=3.4)
gir1.2-webkit-3.0
gir1.2-rsvg-2.0
python3-cherrypy3
python3-requests
python3-simpletal (>=3.12) [for convenience, a copy of simpletal may be
included in this Advene distribution]

For gstreamer, it is useful to also install the gstreamer packages
needed to decode various formats (esp. gstreamer1.0-plugins-bad and
gstreamer1.0-plugins-ugly).

Note that all these dependencies - except python3-simpletal - are
already available in Debian and in standard installations of Ubuntu.

When running on virtual machines (parallels, virtualbox...) : you must
select the X11 video output in Edit/Preferences/Video Player.

** Windows version

If you want to run Advene from sources on win32, you should install in this order (note the version numbers) :

- Python3 v. 3.5 or later (it could be a later version, but check that the PyGobject bindings support it): http://python.org/

- win32process from http://pywin32.sf.net/

- Python bindings for gtk/gstreamer and underlying libs.  There was an
all-in-one installer at
https://wiki.gnome.org/Projects/PyGObject/OldIndex but it is
outdated. You should use http://www.msys2.org/ to install Gtk,
Gstreamer and other libs. See the information on the [Quodlibet
website](https://github.com/quodlibet/quodlibet/tree/master/win_installer)
for more details: it is also a python/gtk3/gstreamer application, you
can use its [bootstrap
script](https://github.com/quodlibet/quodlibet/blob/master/win_installer/bootstrap.sh)
for setting up the build environment.

- Cherrypy and requests: use pip (in the Scripts/ directory of the python directory)

  pip install cherrypy requests

- SimpleTAL (>=5.2) from
http://www.owlfish.com/software/simpleTAL/download.html [for
convenience, a copy of simpletal is included in this Advene
distribution]

** Mac OS X version

The new Advene code has not yet been tested in Mac OS X environement,
for lack of dedicated hardware. You can consider a donation :-) or try
yourself to install dependencies (python-gi, gtk, gstreamer) using the
linux install information.

* Testing

You can run the script ./bin/advene directly from the source
directory. It will detect that it is running from sources and adapt
its paths to this location.

In a first step, you can try the Advene application without movie player
support by using the "-pdummy" parameter :

  advene -pdummy

To force the use of the gstreamer player, specify:

  advene -pgstreamer

* Installing

To install the application, you can run the setup.py script with
appropriate options. For a standard installation, run

  python setup.py install

Note that it is not necessary to install the application to run it. It
can be used directly from its sources directory.

* Documentation

A user guide is in the public Advene wiki, feel free to contribute:
http://advene.org/wiki/

A summarized list of changes across versions is available in the
CHANGES.txt file.

* Debugging

See docs/debug.txt for information about debugging features used in Advene.
