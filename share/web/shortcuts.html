Advene shortcuts
================

This wiki documents the shortcuts available in the most recent version
of Advene (3.3).

Generic player shortcuts
------------------------

These shortcuts are available in most parts/views of the
interface. The *Control* prefix can be changed to some other special
key on the keyboard (Alt, Meta, Shift...) through `Edit/Preferences`.

-   **Control+Tab** or Control-Space : play/pause the movie. *Note:*
    Using simply Space is a frequent request, but cannot be used here
    since Advene is about annotating videos. We need to be able to
    enter a space character as annotation content, hence it cannot be
    used for control.
-   Control+right/left : go forward/backward in the movie by 2 s
    (customizable through `Edit/Preferences/Time related`)
-   Control+Shift-right/left : go forward/backward in the movie by 5 s
    (customizable through `Edit/Preferences/Time related`)
-   Control+down/up : go forward/backward in the movie by 1/25 s
    (customizable through `Edit/Preferences/Time related`)
-   Control+Shift-down/up : go forward/backward in the movie by 1ms
    (customizable through `Edit/Preferences/Time related`)
-   Control+Home : go to the beginning of the movie
-   Control+End : go to the end of the movie
-   Insert (Linux, Windows) or Alt-Space (Linux, Mac OS X): create a new
    bookmark
-   Insert + Shift or Alt-Space + Shift: create a new bookmark next to
    the current one
-   Numeric/symbolic keypad shortcuts:
    -   0 or Insert: create a new bookmark
    -   5 or Begin: play/pause
    -   8/2 or Up/Down: go forward/backward in the movie by 1/25 s
    -   4/6 or Left/Right: go forward/backward in the movie by 2 s (5 s
        with Shift)
    -   7 or Home: go to the beginning of the movie
    -   1 or End: go to the end of the movie

Fullscreen shortcuts
--------------------

In addition to the generic player shortcuts, additional shorcuts are
available in fullscreen mode.

-   **Tab** or Space : play/pause the movie (no *Control* is needed if
    we are not entering text yet).
-   right/left : go forward/backward in the movie by 2 s (customizable
    through Edit/Preferences/Time related)
-   shift-right/left : go forward/backward in the movie by 5 s
    (customizable through Edit/Preferences/Time related)
-   up/down : go forward/backward in the movie by 1/25 s (optionally
    customizable)
-   Shift-down/up : go forward/backward in the movie by 1ms
    (customizable through Edit/Preferences/Time related)
-   Home : go to the beginning of the movie
-   End : go to the end of the movie
-   1 to 0 keys (top row of the keyboard) display the *n* 10th of the
    movie, i.e. 1 displays the first 10% (goes to the beginning), 2
    displays the second 10%, etc. As a convenience for french users
    (AZERTY keyboard), the Shift key does not have to be pressed to get
    the behaviour, simply press the key with the number on it.

Main GUI
--------

-   Control-q : quit the application
-   Control-s : save the package
-   Control-k : select the quicksearch entry
-   Control-a : open the EditAccumulator
-   Control-e : get the evaluator window (for advanced users)

Timeline
--------

### Timeline background

-   `p` : play the movie at the cursor position
-   single-click in the snapshots zone/timescale: play at the cursor
    position
-   double-click in the background: play at the cursor position
-   single-click in the background: unlock the inspector if it was
    locked
-   `c` : center the timeline on the current player position
-   draw a rectangle on the background: if the area covers at least one
    annotation, select covered annotations. Else, propose to either
    create an annotation or to zoom on the selected area.

### Annotation widget

-   simple click: player the annotation and lock the inspector on this
    annotation
-   `e` or double-click : edit the annotation
-   `a` : adjust annotation begin time
-   `A` : adjust annotation end time
-   `h` : toggle highlight annotation (in all views)
-   `Return` : quickly edit the annotation (textual content only).
-   `p` : play the annotation (either at the beginning or the end,
    depending on the cursor position)
-   `space` : play the focused annotation (even if the cursor is not
    on the annotation widget)
-   control+click : set the annotation begin or end (depending on the
    cursor position) to the current movie time
-   control+scroll : update the annotation begin or end (depending on
    the cursor position) time. Holding Shift uses a larger increment
-   control+return : split the annotation at the current player position
    (if the position is in the annotation's bounds)
-   `Delete` or `Backspace` : delete the annotation
-   Drag-and-drop of an annotation on another one: popup a menu to
    propose to create a relation, merge annotations or align bounds.

### Quick edit mode

Quick-edit mode is obtained in the timeline by pressing Enter while the
mouse pointer is over an annotation. It allows to edit the annotation
content through a small text entry with the following shortcuts:

-   `Return`: validate the new content
-   `Escape`: cancel the editing
-   `Tab`: validate the content and quick-edit the following annotation

### Annotation-type widget

-   `e` : edit the annotation-type
-   `a` : display the Shot validation interface
-   `Return` : create a new annotation with the current position as begin
    time, edit it, and use the new current position value as end time
    when validating
-   `Space` : restrict playing to annotations of the given annotation-type
    (toggle)

Active bookmarks
----------------

-   Shift+DND on a timestamp: move the timestamp
-   Control+DND on a timestamp : copy the timestamp
-   Control+D: duplicate a bookmark
-   See also the bookmark creation shortcuts (Insert/Alt-Space) in the
    [\#Generic\_player\_shortcuts](#Generic_player_shortcuts "wikilink")

Note-taking
-----------

-   `Control-Return` : insert a timestamp mark (if the movie is playing)
-   `Control-Shift-Return` : pause and insert a timestamp mark
-   `Control-PageDown/PageUp` : go to next/previous mark
-   Control-Scroll on a mark: update the mark timestamp. If the
    play-on-scroll option is set, the player will be set to the new
    position when the control key is released.
-   Control-Shift-Scroll: update the timestamp with a larger step
    (customizable through Edit/Preferences/Time related)
-   Control-Click in the text in single-click-insert mode : move cursor
    (instead of inserting a mark)
-   `Control-C`: convert transcription into annotations

Table view
----------

- `Return` edits the content of the annotation
- `Control-<`/`Control->` modifies begin/end time
- `Space` or `Control-Return` plays the selected annotation

Element Edition popup
---------------------

### Text and generic content handler

-   `Control-s` : save the content
-   `Control-o` : get the content from a file
-   `Control-r` : reload the content (re-uses the filename used to save)
-   `Control-i` : insert a TALES expression or result from the package
    browser (text content only)

### Timecode edit widget

-   Click on image: play the movie
-   Control+click on image: set the value to current player time
-   Control+scroll on image: modify the value
-   Right click: display a popup menu, which offers to save the
    screenshot, adjust the timestamp through the frame selector or use
    the current player time.

Evaluator
---------

For advanced users, a python shell is available to directly access the
internal API. Feel free to tinker with it but there are no safeguards.

-   F1: display the help message
-   Control-w: close the window
-   Control-Return: evaluate the expression
-   Control-l: clear the expression buffer
-   Control-S: save the expression buffer
-   Control-n: next item in history
-   Control-p: previous item in history
-   Control-PageUp/PageDown: scroll the output window
-   Control-s: save the output
-   Control-d: display completion possibilities
-   Tab: perform autocompletion
-   Control-h: display docstring for element before cursor
-   Control-H: display source for element before cursor
