advene (3.15) unstable; urgency=medium

   The largest change in this release is the corpus management features
    and template integration that have been developped thanks to funding
    from the LARSH laboratory (UPHF) in order to instrument the REMIND
    method.

  * Corpus management features (i.e. multi-package)
    - load/save corpuses (multiple packages)
    - build a corpus by recursively searching for packages in a directory
    - display corpus statistics, with aggregated information by annotation type
    - configurable Xlsx export of corpus data
    - website export of a whole corpus
    - merge a template in a whole corpus
    - execute global actions on a corpus (search/replace, etc)

  * Direct integration of specialized templates for REMIND method and AdA methodology

  * Table view:
    - export CSV export as toolbar icon, and make columns reorderable
    - dynamically filter data
    - when opening the table view, add options to display all package annotations or all corpus annotations

advene (3.12) unstable; urgency=medium

  * Note-taking: new shortcut Escape (Play or Pause + seek -2s)

  * The gstrecorder pseudo video-player is functional again. It allows you
    to record a video, while taking live notes and annotations. After the
    recording is stopped, the video is available along the corresponding
    annotations.

  * Annotations in timeline can be resized by dragging their border to
    either a time position in the timeline background, or to another
    annotation to align it with the begin or end position.

  * In timeline, it is possible to offset a selection of annotations.

  * Fix a text importer bug that ignored the last line of the input file

  * New FlatJSON importer - able to import back the data exported through
    the FlatJSON export filter. Note that this format does not convey all
    Advene information - it is meant as a technical export format
    (esp. for Web-based visualisations), not as an alternative saving
    format.

  * advene_import/advene_export scripts have been moved to bin/

  * New exporter: Audacity label format

  * The website exporter now uses the generic Export API

  * Fix issues in scene change video processing filter.

advene (3.9) unstable; urgency=medium

  * Update the HTML component to WebKit2 to be compatible with Ubuntu20

  * Settings directory is now called "Advene3" on Windows and MacOSX, to
    avoid confusion with previous versions of Advene. It was already
    different on Linux. Your preferences will be reset.

  * Video fragments can be extracted from annotations, annotation types or video montages.

  * New checker comparing annotation content-types to their type's content-type.

  * New GstImporter generic API, facilitating the definition of
    video-processing plugins based on Gstreamer.

  * New VIAN importer.

  * New WebAnnotation importer.

  * New shot detection algorithm based on Gstreamer's scenechange. It is
    called "Scene change detection". The ShotDetect based algorithm is
    still available.

 -- Olivier Aubert <contact@olivieraubert.net>  Tue, 09 Jun 2020 19:35:49 +0200

advene (3.7) unstable; urgency=medium

  * Various bug fixes

  * Implement WebAnnotationExporter (JSON-LD format). The current loaded package
    can be exported through
    http://localhost:1234/packages/advene/export/WebAnnotationExporter

  * New content checker for empty contents

  * Timeline view: create multiple relations by DNDing from/to a selection

  * Note taking view:
    - add the ability to specify custom prefix/suffix texts for timestamp marks
    - allow to disable mark insertion on single/double click

 -- Olivier Aubert <contact@olivieraubert.net>  Wed, 19 Jun 2019 18:08:17 +0200

advene (3.6) unstable; urgency=medium

  * New "Keyword list" annotation type
    (text/x-advene-keyword-list). It defines a dedicated syntax for
    annotation content.  A KeywordList annotation stores a list of
    keywords, separated by a comma. An optional comment can be added
    between parentheses.

    Metadata (color, URI, etc) can be associated to keywords at the type level.

    Using KeywordList annotations impacts the behaviour of the quickfill
    entry system: when on an annotation, pressing 1 to 9 key will *toggle*
    the nth predefined keyword in the annotation content. This allows to
    quickly input a list of keywords.

  * New CompletionChecker checks for non-predefined keywords in annotation
    contents

  * Basic schema statistics are displayed in the Finder view

  * Improve package merge interface. It now allows to merge multiple
    packages in a single action.

  * New command-line scripts merge_package and export_package

  * Timeline: line height can now vary (they are now larger for numeric
    values types). A static image of the whole timeline can be exported
    (right click on the tab to get the timeline menu).

  * New generic exporter API. It allows to define python-based exporters
    through plugins. It defines a default JsonFlatExporter.

  * New keyword extraction plugin (right click on an annotation type to test it).

  * New rdflib-based AdARDFexporter, with multiple output formats. This
    plugin uses specific metadat from AdA project, but can be used as a
    reference implementation for other similar needs.

  * New /export global method.

 -- Olivier Aubert <contact@olivieraubert.net>  Wed, 03 Oct 2018 16:22:58 +0200

advene (3.5) unstable; urgency=medium

  * In Search/Replace dialog for annotations, leaving the search field
    empty will replace the whole content for all annotations (mainly
    useful when invoked on a specific type).

  * Information about distinct annotation values is displayed in
    annotation statistics (accessible in the inspector of the timeline, or
    through the finder).

  * Merge view:
    * add a "Type" column to enable element sorting
    * add a "Selection" button to toggle the selected state on a whole selection

  * New feature: package import (menu File/Import package). It proposes to
    import selected types and their annotations from another package
    (without overwriting existing ones). This may be more convenient to
    integrate work from different annotators.

  * Table view: search-as-you type is disabled, and new shortcuts are
    used: Return edits the content of the current row in place,
    Control-Return opens the edit component for the current annotation,
    and Space plays the player at the annotation position.

  * Timeline view: if more than 2000 annotations are to be displayed, do
    not display all annotation types by default. Instead, open the dialog
    so that the user selects the desired annotation types.

  * Quick completion fill: in both Timeline and Table view, a new edition
    mode is available. If the appropriate option is checked (in
    Edit/Preferences/Text-related), then pressing a numerical key between
    1 and 9 will set the content of the currently active annotation to the
    nth predefined keyword for the given type. In the timeline view, if
    the cursor is over an annotation type, then pressing a 1-9 key will
    create a new annotation at the current player time, with the content
    of the nth predefined keyword.

  * Shot validation: snapshots are scaled according to the available
    space.

  * The PlayerSet event has been renamed to PlayerSeek

 -- Olivier Aubert <contact@olivieraubert.net>  Fri, 17 Nov 2017 21:01:17 +0100

advene (3.4) unstable; urgency=medium

  * A huge memory leak affecting 3.3 (due to python3 migration) has been
    fixed.

  * Imagecache refactoring - it now uses actual framerate information from
    the video file to determine the best screenshot for a given timestamp.

  * Import/export filter options are preserved between invocations.

  * Timeline: selection can be extended to all annotations (of the same
    type or all annotations) in the same time range as the selected
    annotations.

  * Various bugfixes

 -- Olivier Aubert <contact@olivieraubert.net>  Thu, 12 Oct 2017 12:06:44 +0200

advene (3.3) unstable; urgency=medium

  * Port to Python3! Expect some new interesting bugs...

  * Internal

  - Python3 port. This implies str/bytes and integer division issues.

  - Python3 Cherrypy (for template interpretation) uses python3 HTML
    parser which is now more strict (esp. TAL instructions are not
    interpreted in <style> and <script> elements, since they are
    data). This means that some view templates may need to be reworked.

  - The standard logging API is used throughout all the code, and
    everything is displayed in the log messages windows as well as saved
    to a file.

  * Shot validation view: improve shortcuts handling and use Down/Up for
    previous/next shot navigation.

  * Allow to customize generic player controls shortcut modifier (Control
    by default) through Edit/Preferences/GUI. It allows to choose a
    shortcut that does not conflict with other uses, depending on the
    OS/environment.

  * Integrate concept detection code (courtesy of Christian Hentschel
    <christian.hentschel@hpi.uni-potsdam.de>). The server code is
    available as a Docker image.

  * Allow to split a package using a reference annotation type. For every
    reference annotation, a new package will be created with the
    annotations that are in the same time range as the reference
    annotation.

  * Allow to search for text in annotations from all loaded packages (not
    just the active one) by setting the corresponding option of the Search
    button (top-right corner in the interface).

  * Audio segmentation extractor: add a minimum silence duration parameter.

advene (3.0) unstable; urgency=medium

  * Upgrade libs to Gtk3 / Gstreamer 1.0

  * Preferences are now stored in json format, the old preferences file
    advene.prefs is converted and can be removed.

  * Many bug fixes, probably some bug introduction

  * Completion:

    - Content completion is available when editing through table view or
      timeline quick edit mode.

    - New global option completion: if there are predefined terms for the
      annotation type, then use only these terms. Else fallback on dynamic
      completion.

    - Annotation type predefined terms used only space as separator (and
      thus could not contain spaces). If a comma is present in the terms
      field, then it will be considered as separator, allowing to define
      terms containing spaces.

  * Table view:
    - new shortcuts Control-< and Control-> to modify begin/end time
    - export to CSV action

  * WebAnnotation export filter

  * OWL Schema importer

advene (1.0) unstable; urgency=low

  * This release marks the end of a series that has been stable for a long
    time, but never earned its major release number. This version now
    enters a maintenance state, while development focuses on the next
    major version (new data model, interface revamp to handle simultaneous
    analysis of multiple video files...).

  * Main GUI:

     * Left-clicking on the video slider jumps to the designated position.

  * Note-taking view - new shortcut: Ctrl-C to convert to annotations

  * Timeline:

     * The annotation inspector can be locked on an annotation by clicking
       on it. Clicking on the lock icon or in the timeline background unlocks
       the inspector. The annotation content can be edited through the
       inspector, and validated either with an icon, or with the
       Control-Return shortcut.

  * Annotation table view:

     * Annotation contents can be modified from the table view.

     * New shortcut: Ctrl-Return to play current annotation.

  * Transcription view - new shortcut: Ctrl-Return to play current annotation.

  * Importers:

     * WebVTT files can be imported.

     * Speech recognition has been implemented through the pocketsphinx
       speech recognition software. The pocketsphinx software is not bundled
       with Advene and has to be installed separately to enable this
       feature. See http://cmusphinx.sourceforge.net/wiki/gstreamer for
       details.

  * The additional videoplayer offset can be customized by drag and drop
    of an annotation.

  * The popup menu on screenshot and annotations now offers to save the
    screenshot as a PNG file. If the player supports it, the screenshot
    will be in video-resolution.

advene (0.45) unstable; urgency=low

  * Main GUI:

    * Timecode display: add HH:MM:SSfNN (frame number) display format in
      preferences. The same syntax can be used for timecode input too. Note
      that it uses 25 fps by default (smpte-25), this can be modified in the
      Time-related preferences (it does not yet get this information
      from each video file).

    * The snapshotter activity can be monitored and controlled through
      a green icon in the lower right-hand corner of the main window.

    * The imagecache can be reset from the Player menu.

    * Undo behaviour: implement Undo for annotation/query/view creation.

    * Allow storage of binary data in XML.

    * New menuitems "Create a montage from the relations" and "Create a
      dynamic view following relations" in relation-type popup menu.

    * The comment editor proposes multiple presentation modalities for
      dragged annotation-types.

  * Timeline:

    * Click twice on an annotation will not start playing anymore. This
      caused confusion with double clicks to edit.

    * Define generic relation types (from any annotation type to any type)
      when creating new relation types.

  * Exporters:

    * Two new json exporters.

  * Importers:

    * Advene2 (Cinelab) importer and AIFF (Final Cut Pro) importer

    * Audio/video extraction importers: sound enveloppe, sound detection,
      new shot detection algorithm, feature extraction (face, eyes...). The
      extraction importers can be invoked through the File/Process video
      menu.

    * Options can be specified from the GUI for each import filter

    * For developers: the import framework has been simplified. If you
      want to import data from an external application, use
      util.importer.ExternalAppImporter (and see plugins/shotdetectapp.py
      for an example).

  * Braille table:

    * Long text can be scrolled with left/right buttons in scroll mode.

  * Actions:

    * New parameters (balance, volume) for PlaySound / PlaySoundClip actions

  * Website export can now automatically generate HTML5 <video> code,
    thanks to Madjid Sadallah.

  * Popup menu:

    * Right-click on an annotation, annotation-type or package offers to do
      a search/replace on the concerned annotations content.

    * The video fragment corresponding to an annotation can be extracted
      through the annotation popup menu.

  * Player control

     * The player is automatically started and paused when loading a movie/package.

     * The Play/Pause button is now unique, and the Stop button has been removed.

     * The Mute/Unmute button has been replaced by a volume slider.

     * Rate control is available for the gstreamer plugin.

     * Control-Up/Down keys can be used to navigate with user-specified
       times (without Shift modifier), see Edit/Preferences/Time-related for
       customization.

     * Fullscreen mode now has specific shortcuts. Basically, navigation
       keys (space, left/right, up/down...) can be used without holding
       Control. See
       http://liris.cnrs.fr/advene/wiki/index.php/AdveneShortcuts#Fullscreen_shortcuts
       for more details.

  * Timeline view:

     * If there are more than 1500 annotations, display only 2
       annotation types in the timeline (to speed package loading), and
       propose display options through a dialog.

     * Control+click in the timeline background creates and edits a new
       annotation at the current player position (and in the appropriate
       type)

          * a/A on on annotation invokes the "Frame selector" interface

     * A new toolbar button toggles the display of all defined relations.

  * Table view:

    * Clicking on the snapshot column plays the movie at the specified
      position.

  * Cut validation interface

    * Control-click on a frame creates a new cut instead of adjusting the
      current cut.

    * Implement Undo and action notification

  * When editing textual content, abbreviations can be used to enter text
    more quickly, and automatic completion can be disabled. See
    Edit/Preferences/Text Content for customization.

  * Workspace is now always saved in the package and restored at loading
    in the standard configuration. See Edit/Preferences/Workspace for
    configuration.

  * Text-To-Speech engine can be more finely configured (cf
    Edit/Preferences). Available engines are: espeak, festival, MacOS X
    "say" command, MS SAPI5 interface, custom script.

  * SVG overlay over the video is available. It has performance issues on
    MacOS X though and is thus disable in the standard configuration. See
    Edit/Preferences/Video player settings to enable/disable this feature.

  * Multiple video players can be simultaneously opened. They are
    synchronized (with the possibility to specify an offset). This allows
    for instance the visualisation of multiple videos of the same event.

  * New global shortcut: Control-Shift-Up/Down moves player by a
    user-specified time value (initially 1ms)

  * Mouse wheel in video window moves frame-by-frame (if
    possible). Right-click in video window sets a bookmark.

  * Ad-hoc views:

     * A new frame-precise time selector can be invoked through the a
      (adjust begin time) or A (adjust end time) shortcut on an annotation.

     * A shot validation interface is accessible through the
       annotation-type popup menu ("Ajust annotation bounds").

     * Timeline:

        * annotations containing a series of numeric values can be
          displayed as bargraphs.

        * SVG graphics are displayed in the timeline widgets.

        * right-clicking in the timeline background now proposes to create
          an annotation at the current player position.

        * when selecting an empty zone, propose to zoom on region or limit
          display to region (in addition to creating an annotation).

        * when display is limited to a time range, display navigation
          tools in the upper left-hand corner.

     * Treeview: annotations are sorted according to their begin time.

     * New trace preview visualisation.

     * Trace timeline: various improvements.

     * Montage view: The current playing position is displayed.

     * Tag bag: add "Display all tags" option

     * Edit view: text completion vocabulary can be initialised per
       annotation-type: edit the annotation-type, select "Advanced" and enter
       a space-separated list of words in the "Completions" entry. This
       allows to have some kind of controlled vocabulary in annotations.

     * Popup accumulator: it is automatically put to front when a new
       popup is displayed

  * New exporter: TimedText

  * Log file can be displayed through Help/Display logfile

   * ! On Win32, the home directory (where the "advene" folder for
    configuration files is stored) is now stored in the USERPROFILE
    directory - usually something like C:\Documents and settings\Loginname
    If you had a previous configuration file, please copy it to the new
    directory.

   * Win32 bugfixes (relation creation, timestamp mark colors, montage...)

   * Win32: VLC can be bundled in the Advene installer package

   * New adhoc view : finder (column-based finder a la Mac OS X)

   * New actions:

      * Pronounce (through Text-To-Speech). Works on MacOS X
       (directly) and Linux (with festival configured to output through
       ALSA, cf http://gentoo-wiki.com/HOWTO_speechd#Use_alsa_output_method ).

      * PopupGotoOutgoingRelated: displays a navigation popup based on
       relations.

       behaviour is tunable in Edit/Preferences/Standard views

      * A first-time simple configuration dialog is displayed for new users.

      * Advene can check daily if a new release exists, if the appropriate
       option (menu Edit/Preferences/General) is turned on, or through the
       Help/Check for updates menu.

      * The SVG-subset editor handles text shapes and links, and shapes can
       be reordered

      * A new content mimetype, application/x-advene-values, allows to

   * Quicksearch:

      * Search-options are now displayed when left-clicking on the search
       button.

      * A Google-like syntax can be used: search for multiple word,

       quotes to specify "words with whitespaces"

      * When searching for a single word, it will also be highlighted in
       opened transcription and note-taking views.

      * It is possible to search/replace text in the content of the
       annotations in a query result.

   * Timeline:

      * Double click on an annotation will open its edit window rather than
       simply edit its content (which is always possible with Return)

      * It is possible to select multiple annotations, either with
       shift-click on the annotation widget or by defining a region around
       the annotations. It is then possible to edit, duplicate, delete or
       zoom over selected annotations, through the selection toolbar item or
       the timeline context menu.

      * Screenshots can be displayed in the timeline scale, by
       redimensionning the scale vertical dimension. Screenshots are usually
       generated on annotation bounds, but can also be generated every 500ms
       through the Player/Generate Screenshots menuitem.

      * Buttons for previous/next annotation are present at the right of
       the annotation-type widget. The legend must be resized for them to
       appear, in order not to take too much space by default.

      * If the timeline displays only a subset of annotations (e.g. the
       result of a search), the "Restrict playing" will play only the
       selected annotations in the type.

   * Note-taking:

      * Marks are inserted with double-click

      * It is possible to search for a string

      * Note-taking views can be saved as adhoc-views

      * The convert dialog has been revamped

   * Transcription:

      * Double-click in the text will play the corresponding annotation

   * Dynamic views:

      * The TALES expression for the predefined values is displayed in the
       tooltip.

      * The composition operator for conditions can be chosen (and/or)

      activated upon view activation)

      * Predefined values are proposed for action parameters

   * To rename a view, double-click on its tab.

   * Error messages are now saved to ~/.advene/advene.log (for win32 users,

   * It is possible to enter a googlevideo/youtube/dailymotion URL in the
    "File/Select a video stream" dialog.

   * Annotation coloring: a new global method, tag_color, has been
    introduced to offer a color tagging facility. To use it, you must
    specify the TALES expression "here/tag_color" as the "color" attribute
    of the annotation type, and set the tag color through the tag bag
    view.

   * DVD device/drive: it can be configured from the Player preferences window

   * File import: allow to choose the desired import filter, and display a
    progress bar

   * Adhoc-views (timeline, transcription...): parametered adhoc-views can

    annotation types in the timeline) and restored. To save them, use the
    "Save view" menuitem from the view tab contextual menu (right click on
    the view name). To restore them, do a right-click or drag and drop
    from the item in the tree view.

        * Transcription view: it now uses a TALES expression as
          argument. It can thus display query results or any set of annotations
          as a transcription. Preferences offer a set of predefined separators.

        * Bag of tags: this new view allows to manage tags applied to
          elements (mostly annotations), through drag-and-drop.

        * Timeline: new shortcut ('t') to toggle tooltips display

   * New file format: .apl (Advene package list). It is used to save a work
        session (list of opened packages), from the File/Save session menu.

   * The default template is now template.azp, so that new packages have a
    Resources reference by default.

   * A RelationType can specify a "Any annotation type" as member

   * Importers: implemented importer for .iri files

   * preliminary tags support has been implemented for annotations and
    relations (based on Frank Wagner work)

   * new annotation methods to deal with relations:
      * relatedOut and relatedIn return a list of related (outgoing or
      incoming) annotations.
      * typedRelatedOut and typedRelatedIn return a dictionary indexed by
      relation type id, which holds the list of related annotations.
      * typedIncomingRelations/typedOutgoingRelations: return categorized relations

   * GUI:

      * it is possible to load multiple packages in the GUI. Only one
      package is active at a time (for movie, dynamic views...) but it is
      possible to easily switch between packages (through the Packages
      menuitem) and access to all packages data is possible through the
      webserver.

      The /packages/advene expression always represents the currently active
      package. Other packages are accessed through expressions like
      /packages/alias

      The alias is automatically generated from the filename, and can be
      modified in the file selector dialog.

      * merge functionality (menu File/Merge): elements from another package
      can be merged into the current package.

      * the player control toolbar has been put beneath the video output,
      and is hidden in embedded adhoc views. The main player control
      toolbar presents a volume control widget.

      * non-text resources/contents are handled by a GenericContentHandler,
      that offers loading/saving to/from a file.

      * it is possible to insert a resource directly from a file

      * if the user tries to open a videofile through the Open package
      menuitem, do what is expected (select the videofile).

      * default adhoc views to be opened/embedded on application startup can
      be specified through the Preferences menu

      * better drag and drop interaction with other applications

      * optionally ask to save the imagecache on exit (cf preferences)

      * in interactive query (menu Edit/Find), propose multiple output modes
        (timeline, edit window, python evaluator), and offer a simplified
        search box to search for a string in the annotations content.

   * Views:

      * view notebooks are also used for the right-hand side of the video

      * added a GenericContentHandler to edit non-text resources

      * snapshots can be invalidated from the annotation edition popup
     (right-click on the snapshot)

      annotations

      * timeline:

      * it is possible to specify the ordered list of
        displayed annotation types

      * annotations can be resized by dragging the bounds (must be dragged
        on the layout background, not on another annotation)

      * relations are represented by lines, with a dot as starting
        point. Annotations with relations are underlined (rather than bold)

      * annotations can be split through their context menu

      * annotations can be created from the popup menu (with a default
        duration of 1/20 of the media duration)

      * control + scrollwheel on an annotation widget
        increments/decrements the value of the begin or
        end. Control+shift+scrollwheel moves the whole annotation.

      * control+click on the begin or end of the annotation sets the
        bound to the current player position value

      * autoscroll can either scroll discontinuously, or keep the current
        mark centered and continuously scroll the widgets

      * annotation widget shortcuts: 'e' to edit, 'p' to play (begin or
        end, depending on the cursor position), 'Return' to quickly edit the
        content, space plays the active annotation (even it the cursor is
        not on the annotation widget)

      * shortcut: 'p' in the timeline background plays the movie at the
        cursor position.

      * annotations can be colored according to a TALES expression from
        their type

      * new button "Center on current position"

      * new contextual action "Center and zoom", to center and zoom on the
        given annotation

      * some basic type checking and conversion is done when transmuting
        annotations

      * Return on an annotation type will create a new annotation "on the
        fly" (aligned with the current video time).

      * display parameters of the timeline (font-size, button height...) are
      customizable through the Preferences dialog

      * if the gtkmozembed or gtkhtml2 library is present, DnD of the web
      browser button will embed a HTML view in the GUI.

      * allow to get a transcription either for the whole package, or for
        a given annotation type

      * it is possible to import existing annotations

      * when converting to annotations, propose to delete existing
        annotations of the given type

      * control+scroll on a timestamp mark updates the timestamp. If the
        play-on-scroll option is active, the player will play the new
        timestamp when the control key is released.

   * Webserver

      * /action displays links (with form if necessary for
        parameters) in the list of actions

advene (0.20) unstable; urgency=low

   * New package format (.azp, for Advene Zip Package) allowing to embed
    resources (files) in packages. You can save old .xml files into .azp
    files to get them converted. For instance,
    access to resources is done through the TALES expression
    package/resources/style.css
    To use this resource in a TAL template, you can then use:
    <link tal:attributes="href package/resources/style.css/absolute_url" type="text/css" rel="stylesheet" />

   * A filename extension (.azp or .xml) is automatically appended if not
    present.

   * Advene now depends on gtk >= 2.8

   * New global method: related. Returns, for an annotation, its related
    annotation. It is a shortcut useful for the case of binary relations:
    annotation/related/id
    is equivalent to
    annotation/outgoingRelations/first/members/last/id

   * global methods can be defined by user plugins (in .advene/plugins
    directory) through controller.register_global_method

   * ! Moved config and preferences files to ~/.advene directory
    (UserDir/advene on Windows)

   * New annotation mimetype (application/x-advene-zone) which allows to
    define rectangular zones.

   * GUI:
      * a view notebook holds the popupaccumulator below the video. It allows
      to embed other views (timeline, treeview, transcription...) simply by
      drag and drop of the view toolbutton into the notebook
      * the treeview can be displayed by default on the right of the video
      window (replacing the less used, for now, URL stack window), see the
      preferences panel
      * added an element creation toolbar
      * generic player control shortcuts are used throughout the program:
        Tab: play/pause
        Control-Left, Control-Right: move forward/backwards
        Home: goto start of the movie
      * Edit/Preferences now allows to modify paths (data, movies, player, imagecache) (from Frank Wagner)
      * Imagecache saves files with a .png extension
      * The not_yet_available image is now loaded from share/pixmaps/notavailable.png

      * clicking on a mark now goes to the position. Use the popup menu to remove marks.
      * control-space now sets a mark and pauses the movie

   * Snapshot cache now saves files with a .png extension (from Frank Wagner)

   * Implemented plugin architecture (user-defined plugins in ~/.advene/plugins)

   * webserver:
      * message log is now available from the menu (View->Webserver log), and
      not displayed on the console
      * new action: /admin/halt (useful for the standalone case)
      * new action: /admin/methods displays the list of available TALES methods
      * new path: /action/ActionName?param=TALESexpr to invoke actions defined
      in the ECA framework

   * Advene no longer depends on the Image module. It only uses it if image
    type conversion is necessary.

   * Added spanish translations (courtesy of Emmanuel Ayala)
   * Bugfix in path initialization

   * Multiple instances can now run simultaneously (only the first instance
    activates its webserver)

   * evaluator: changed some shortcuts (see help), implemented expression history
