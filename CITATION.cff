abstract: >-
  The cross-platform Advene application allows users to
  easily create comments and analyses of video documents,
  through the definition of time-aligned annotations and
  their mobilisation into automatically-generated or
  user-written comment views (HTML documents). Annotations
  can also be used to modify the rendition of the
  audiovisual document, thus providing virtual montage,
  captioning, navigation... capabilities. Users can exchange
  their comments/analyses in the form of Advene packages,
  independently from the video itself.
