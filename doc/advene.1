.SH NAME
advene \- Annotate Digital Videos, Exchange on the NEt
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B advene
.SH DESCRIPTION
The cross-platform \fBadvene\fP  application allows users to easily
create comments and analyses of video comments, through the
definition of time-aligned annotations and their mobilisation
into automatically-generated or user-written comment views (HTML
documents). Annotations can also be used to modify the rendition
of the audiovisual document, thus providing virtual montage,
captioning, navigation... capabilities. Users can exchange their
comments/analyses in the form of Advene packages, independently from
the video itself.

Use the \-\-help option to get a list of command line options.

User documentation is available from the website
https://www.advene.org/

.SH ETYMOLOGY
\fBadvene\fP is an ancient english word, meaning "to be added to
something or become a part of it, though not essential" (Webster
1913). Good match for an annotation application.
