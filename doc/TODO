* controller.get_url_for_alias: use correct baseurl from cherrypy request when possible

* timeline

** Deactivate autoscroll when moving in the timeline

** timeline: reimplement with a proper canvas

** Make relation lines clickable

** timeline: allow view-local tags/color to allow to define a specific color for various annotations for a given timeline (display a point of view, specific to the view)

** timeline parameters: use TALES expressions for each line instead of annotation types (-> we can use queries and also have multiple packages in the same timeline)

** timeline: allow to group annotation types with tags

** timeline: Center on related annotation

** timeline: find a way to render overlapping buttons (cf goocanvas)

* transcribe: add a small timeline on the top that displays the

* Keep /application, or use /action for everything ?

* make most admin views return XML + XSL stylesheets (action, methods...)

* /packages: convert to XML/XSL + offer the possibility to activate a package

* note-taking: integrate Gobby component

* Fix DND to webbrowser on windows
 
* 'auto-import-types': if empty, default to views, schemas, queries. Could also add annotations/relations.

* load/save hooks

* Convention: is_illustrated_by relation-type. In snapshot_url, if a
  relation exists, use it to get the snapshot. Else use the begin
  time.

* define a virtual "global" package that will iterate and forward methods (annotations, relation...) over all loaded packages

* transtyping: preserve/recreate relations

* VerticalList : equiv. navigation history parameterized with 2 tales expressions: item list, representation [ history / annotation/fragment/formatted/duration ]

* component "scroller" below the vout. Parameters: text, href (optional), past duration, current
  duration, future duration [ | past | current | future | ]  

* Audio commentaries : add a "Record" button. While pressed, it
   records. Upon release, it creates an annotation with the correct
   bounds.

* import fixer: allow to edit imports without loading the package
   (which fails if imported package is not accessible).

* allow to edit the path of imported packages, to allow relative paths

* notification of new popups when embedded (flash tab)

* allow to specify the browser for open_url in preferences

* Define a ParameteredQuery which takes a single parameter in the path, e.g.:
  here/annotations/containedIn/foobar 
  (use a wrapper similar to the one used for views. Maybe we can
  generalize this principle).

* Implement transmission of elements between different applications (esp. transmission of annotations [bounds + content] between 2 timelines) -> new target type + element xml repr.

* allow i18n of template.xml

* Pb (QName related) when importing a package importing another one
   (try importing wrong-trousers):
p.imports[0].package.views[1]._getParent().uri, p.imports[1].package.uri
that should return the same URI. The proposed solution is to enforce the importing package to explicitly import the second level imported ones. Pb: namespace clash

* Write a advene-openoffice binding to automate video/presentation sync.

* New action: translate ?

* webserver: implement a wiki-like syntax in views that dynamically generates links to Advene elements/TALES expressions (define a application/x-advene-wiki that will get converted into a TAL template)

* handle wiki syntax in transcriptionedit, so that we can do simple notetaking with some markup easily.

* make navigation history accessible from TALES (/options/history ?)

* keep a viewed_segments structure to propose a view "Not yet viewed sequences"

* Advene tutorial in advene, with a video capture of an interaction session

* New action: display a fragment of a video then continue from the
position where the link was activated. Parameters: fragment to play,
return position, or display in a new video window

* navigation history: put 2 snapshots (origin, destination) to contextualize

* controller.update: implement a future_approaching and a
future_leaving to implement a -2 seconds before / +2 seconds after
annotation event.

* Add a "release" script that updates the version number in:
  debian/changelog
  lib/advene/core/version.py (+ date)
  advene.iss
 + wget Twiki:AdveneUserGuide to doc/user.html (cf scripts/update_doc)

* browser: select base element (annotation, package, ...)

* Item File->statistics : element count (ann, rel, etc)

* Implement "copy/paste" on elements

* In Context (or the GUI), catch AdveneTalesException that happens
when there is a syntax error in a TALES expression (missing string orbadly written symbol) and display a meaningful message

* Annotation song: lyrics / refrain /couplet + UTBV/STBV (transcription)

* Create a 'shapes' package which will define various SVG shapes
  (moon, sun, triangle, etc) as views

* Edit element popup: check that the data was not modified before closing

* Model related:

** Model: Implement copy/rename of id for all elements

** Allow to specify preferred package (bootstrap) for default views

** schema.author error ?? Cf importer.py (ElanImporter)

** Bug in util.uri.urljoin if pkg_uri == 'dummy:1' (get does not work
in bundles). To exhibit: in ElanImporter, change the uri of the new
package to 'dummy:1'

** The model should check the data validity (no duplicated id, valid id syntax, etc)

** Model: proper handling of exceptions (for instance, a view is
imported and its id changes in the imported package -> KeyError
exception)

** Model: annotations should be sorted according to fragment.begin

** Before that, implement a hook for LoadPackage and AnnotationEditEnd
which sorts the annotations upon package load.

** Clean the mediafile handling. It should be stored in fragments, or
at least all fragments should be scanned upon package loading to
determine the available stream(s) and propose them to the user.

** Make some attributes inherited (esp. author for annotations, media for fragments)

** The view method should return a Content object, so that we can get
 its mimetype. *or* return a specialized class derived from (str,
 object) that adds a mimetype property

** Create a ContextualizedBundle which understands namespaces

** Fix package generation: upon loading, we discard the initial
processing instruction (<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>) from
the DOM and do not restore it before saving, so it gets lost.

** Find a way to override standard advene elements with new methods
(for instance, snapshot_url and media_control for annotations) in
order to avoid using too many global methods.

** Import elements GUI: implement "Add/Remove package" -> ready, but need the corresponding method in the model to remove

** Model: Pb in imported packages:
  [ s.title for s in p.imports[1].package.schemas ] works but
  [ s.id for s in p.imports[1].package.schemas ] does not:

 File "advene/model/modeled.py", line 185, in getId
  File "/usr/local/src/advene-project/lib/advene/model/package.py", line 258, in getQnamePrefix
    raise AdveneException ("item %s has no QName prefix in %s" %
AdveneException: item Package (english_teacher.xml) has no QName prefix in Package (../examples/unicode.xml

** Model: Implement importElement methods (or at least, document the existing ones and add an importPackage() to be able to specify the package's alias)

** Model: implement relationtype.members R/W (and make that a list of
AnnotationTypes rather than their ids) -> DONE for R/W.

** model: implement a data PATH variable to look for packages. Insert
the current package's pwd first as default.

* Treeview: add the elements attributes as annotation/relation children.

* Content: how to represent structured data ? Cf MPEG7 DS ? (hackingly
  half DONE, grep source for application/x-advene-structured). Or
http://www.rexx.com/~dkuhlman/generateDS.html (XML-Schema) Or SOAPy

* Assistants:
  - voice recognition
  - relation creation (based on criteria like "shot in sequence" -> isPartOf)

* Timeline:
  - copy/paste paradigm
  - concurrent annotation representation
  - annotation alignment (=~ arrange/align in Impress)
  - ability to specify line order and which types to display

* Add sound_set_volume and sound_get_volume to MediaControl.idl -> DONE

* Rules: add a "internal" flag to indicate whether to save/edit or not
  the rule (internal=True by default) -> DONE (rule.origin)
  But we do not use it : instead, the ecaengine uses multiple rulesets
  ('default', 'internal' and 'user' by default)

* Implement attributes first and last in bundles (easy) -> DONE (in global_methods)

* Put relations in a <relations></relations> container, so that we
  have a consistent package/relations/ access (else, relation/absolute_url
  returns annotations/id, which is misleading) -> half DONE (absolute_url fixed)

* Add a /config directory, holding config values for the user (esp.
  edit window width and height) and implement PUT method on it
  through a /options/config dict in TALES -> DONE

* Correct all edit plugins (to correctly update values) -> DONE
  * Add self.model everywhere
  * Add self.editlist everywhere, to register edit plugins inside
    the self edit plugin.  update_value will be called upon these.

* Metadata : cache the stream duration (for GUI purposes) -> DONE

* Debian package: add python-xml python-simpletal dependencies -> DONE

* Implement an ApproximateImageCache with a ic.epsilon value -> DONE

* The content object should provide a "dom tree" access method -> DONE (content.getModel) 
  but not cleanly

* Adveneserver: use logging.Logger to log HTTP accesses -> DONE

* Add a "Edit" button next to the STBV optionmenu -> DONE

* Fix the UpdateElement problem in tree view when creating a new
element (maybe we should have AnnotationCreate and AnnotationEdit
events) -> DONE

* gui.main should catch the information about a new view being defined and update the
  interface accordingly (for instance, a new annotation type or a new
  dynamic view created) -> DONE 

* More quickly : STBV Optionmenu should only have a reference to the STBV id, so that
  the new version is taken into account when edited. -> useless

* Implement a representation meta-attribute that gives a TALES
  expression whose evaluation will return the representation string of
  the element (useful for parsed elements for instance) -> DONE (meta 'display')

* Query language: either python-based (very generic) or reusing the
  rules framework (conditions) -> DONE

* Implement query in global_methods -> DONE

* Clean-up the player interface (which is now spread across
  advene.util.vlclib.VLCPlayer and advene.core.mediacontrol.MediaControl) -> half DONE
  (everything is in mediacontrol now, but we should unify this and provide a clean API
   to ease portability across different players). Idea: provide a

** The package/annotationTypes should have an 'ids' method, to be able
to retrieve ids as keys (all bundles in fact) -> HACKED in bundles

* Action: ActivateSTBV -> DONE

* Views should memorize their position/size (idea: have a
gui.size_cache dict, indexed with window names ("edit", "timeline",
"tree", ...) and containing sizes). It should be saved upon quitting

** Implement a 'webcam' player/recorder plugin -> cf gstrecorder

** predefined sources (all annotations, annotations of type...) / condition (content / duration)
 / output

   allow to take notes on the fly while recording a speech
   [http://divmod.org/projects/shtoom] -> gstrecord

* Implement in controller.current_annotation which would allow
   to loop on an annotation through an internal rule : on
   current_annotation end goto currentannotation.fragment.begin

   information in rules. A state root element (dict) that would be
   reset on some events? ]
