# Debugging

Advene uses the standard python `logging` module for logging
purposes. The default level is INFO. To activate DEBUG messages for
specific modules, use the ADVENE_DEBUG environment variable which
holds a colon-separated list of module names for which to activate
debug messages. Every module is designated either by its dotted named
(e.g. advene.core.controller) or (if it is loaded through the plugin
framework) with undescore separators (e.g. advene_gui_views_timeline).

For instance, to debug the timeline view as well as the controller, you can use

ADVENE_DEBUG=advene.core.controller:advene_gui_views_timeline ./bin/advene

The "-d" option activates some specific code paths. Among other
things, it loads the advene.util.debug module.

## Pdb invocation

You can set (through the python evaluator) the config.data.livedebug
variable to True (it is False by default). This will cause pdb to be
invoked upon exceptions, allowing to inspect the stack.
